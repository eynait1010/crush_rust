## Guessing Game

## 3.Common Programming Concepts
### 3.1 Variables and Mutability
- let
- mut
- const
- shadowing 

### 3.2 Data Types
#### Scalar Types
- - [ ] i8 (-2^7 - 2^7-1)
- u8 (0 - 2^7-1)
- - [ ] Two's complement
- - [ ] Floating-Point Types
- isize usize
#### Compound Types
##### tuple
- pattern matching 
- destructure
##### array
- Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap
- Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. 
- Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

##### vector
- heap
